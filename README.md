# dummy-chargepoint

## üîç About

**dummy-chargepoint** is a command-line driven *Java* application to emulate a chargepoint using the 
[*OCPP* protocol](https://openchargealliance.org/).  
It started as a [school project](https://esipe.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/formations/informatique-design-architecture-et-developpement-option-geomatique-logiciel-ou-reseau/last-project)
for a company. We've wanted to study and push this idea of an *API* which uses this protocol to configure multiple
chargepoints in real-time, and offer in the meantime, a user-friendly web application using the *API*.

**dummy-chargepoint** fits in our plan because it allows us to manually test the *OCPP* protocol.

## üìù How to build

To build the application, follow these steps:

```shell
  # Clone the git repository
  git clone git@github.com:LastProject-ESIEE/dummy-chargepoint.git

  # Navigate to the project directory
  cd dummy-chargepoint
  
  # Check if everything is OK (test and compile)
  mvn clean verify
  
  # Package the project
  mvn package
```
